		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>
			I am a Chinese Marketing & Brand manager currently validating a master degree in <a href="https://student.kedge.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>KEDGE business school</strong></a> in France. I am looking for an opportunity in a cross-cultural and dynamic team in the Bordeaux area. I am especially interested in international brands who would like to enter and develop in the Chinese market.
			I had <strong>4 yearsâ€™ Marketing and PR experience</strong> working in <a href="https://flo.cn/" target="_blank"><strong>Group FLO</strong></a> a French group promoting 7 brands of restaurants in Beijing, China. It gave me a practical perspective of how to efficiently introduce French product and culture to Chinese high-end consumers.
			I am a <strong>positive and responsible</strong> team member with leadership quality and strong communication skills. My previous experience showed I can manage projects with high level of organization and a sense of initiative. My current experience in KEDGE Business School allow me to refine my work experience with an academic knowledge on brand development.
			Please send me an invitation to connect if you want to discuss further about any internship or employment opportunity.
